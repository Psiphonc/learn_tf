    "# Graph\n",
    "## Why dataflow graphs?\n",
    "Dataflow is a common programming model for parallel computing. In a dataflow graph, the nodes represent units of computation, and the edges represent the data consumed or produced by a computation. For example, in a TensorFlow graph, the `tf.matmul` operation would correspond to a single node with two incoming edges (the matrices to be multiplied) and one outgoing edge (the result of the multiplication).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataflow has several advantages that TensorFlow leverages when executing your programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallelism**. By using explicit edges to represent dependencies between operations, it is easy for the system to identify operations that can execute in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed** execution. By using explicit edges to represent the values that flow between operations, it is possible for TensorFlow to partition your program across multiple devices (CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs) attached to different machines. TensorFlow inserts the necessary communication and coordination between devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compilation**. TensorFlow's XLA compiler can use the information in your dataflow graph to generate faster code, for example, by fusing together adjacent operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Portability**. The dataflow graph is a language-independent representation of the code in your model. You can build a dataflow graph in Python, store it in a SavedModel, and restore it in a C++ program for low-latency inference.\n",

    "## What is `tf.Graph`\n",
    "A `tf.Graph` contains two relevant kinds of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph structure**. The nodes and edges of the graph, indicating how individual operations are composed together, but not prescribing how they should be used. The graph structure is like assembly code: inspecting it can convey some useful information, but it does not contain all of the useful context that source code conveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph collections**. TensorFlow provides a general mechanism for storing collections of metadata in a `tf.Graph`. The `tf.add_to_collection `function enables you to associate a list of objects with a key (where `tf.GraphKeys` defines some of the standard keys), and `tf.get_collection `enables you to look up all objects associated with a key. Many parts of the TensorFlow library use this facility: for example, when you create a `tf.Variable`, it is added by default to collections representing \"global variables\" and \"trainable variables\". When you later come to create a `tf.train.Saver` or `tf.train.Optimizer`, the variables in these collections are used as the default arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a `tf.Graph`\n",
    "Most TensorFlow programs start with a dataflow graph construction phase. In this phase, you invoke TensorFlow API functions that construct new `tf.Operation` (node) and `tf.Tensor` (edge) objects and add them to a `tf.Graph` instance. TensorFlow provides a default graph that is an implicit argument to all API functions in the same context. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calling `tf.constant(42.0)` creates a single `tf.Operation` that produces the value `42.0`, adds it to the default graph, and returns a `tf.Tensor` that represents the value of the constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calling `tf.matmul(x, y)` creates a single `tf.Operation` that multiplies the values of `tf.Tensor` objects `x` and `y`, adds it to the default graph, and returns a `tf.Tensor` that represents the result of the multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Executing `v = tf.Variable(0)` adds to the graph a `tf.Operation` that will store a writeable tensor value that persists between `tf.Session.run` calls. The `tf.Variable` object wraps this operation, and can be used like a tensor, which will read the current value of the stored value. The `tf.Variable` object also has methods such as `tf.Variable.assign` and `tf.Variable.assign_add` that create `tf.Operation` objects that, when executed, update the stored value. (See Variables for more information about variables.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calling `tf.train.Optimizer.minimize` will add operations and tensors to the default graph that calculates gradients, and return a `tf.Operation` that, when run, will apply those gradients to a set of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programs rely solely on the default graph. However, see Dealing with multiple graphs for more advanced use cases. High-level APIs such as the tf.estimator.Estimator API manage the default graph on your behalf, and--for example--may create different graphs for training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Calling most functions in the TensorFlow API merely adds operations and tensors to the default graph, but does not perform the actual computation. Instead, you compose these functions until you have a `tf.Tensor` or `tf.Operation` that represents the overall computation--such as performing one step of gradient descent--and then pass that object to a `tf.Session` to perform the computation. See the section \"Executing a graph in a `tf.Session`\" for more details.\n",

TensorFlow automatically chooses a unique name for each operation in your graph, but giving operations descriptive names can make your program easier to read and debug. The TensorFlow API provides two ways to override the name of an operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each API function that creates a new `tf.Operation` or returns a new `tf.Tensor` accepts an optional name argument. For example, `tf.constant(42.0, name=\"answer\")` creates a new tf.Operation named \"answer\" and returns `a tf.Tensor` named \"answer:0\". If the default graph already contains an operation named \"answer\", then TensorFlow would append \"_1\", \"_2\", and so on to the name, in order to make it unique.\n",
    "\n",

The current name scope prefix is a \"/\"-delimited list of the names of all active `tf.name_scope` context managers. If a name scope has already been used in the current context, TensorFlow appends \"_1\", \"_2\", and so on. For example:"

    "## Programming with multiple graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When training a model, a common way of organizing your code is to use one graph for training your model, and a separate graph for evaluating or performing inference with a trained model. In many cases, the inference graph will be different from the training graph: for example, techniques like dropout and batch normalization use different operations in each case. Furthermore, by default utilities like `tf.train.Saver` use the names of `tf.Variable` objects (which have names based on an underlying `tf.Operation`) to identify each variable in a saved checkpoint. When programming this way, you can either use completely separate Python processes to build and execute the graphs, or you can use multiple graphs in the same process. This section describes how to use multiple graphs in the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, TensorFlow provides a \"default graph\" that is implicitly passed to all API functions in the same context. For many applications, a single graph is sufficient. However, TensorFlow also provides methods for manipulating the default graph, which can be useful in more advanced use cases. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `tf.Graph` defines the namespace for `tf.Operation` objects: each operation in a single graph must have a unique name. TensorFlow will \"uniquify\" the names of operations by appending \"_1\", \"_2\", and so on to their names if the requested name is already taken. Using multiple explicitly created graphs gives you more control over what name is given to each operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The default graph stores information about every `tf.Operation` and `tf.Tensor` that was ever added to it. If your program creates a large number of unconnected subgraphs, it may be more efficient to use a different `tf.Graph` to build each subgraph, so that unrelated state can be garbage collected.\n",
    "  \n",
    "You can install a different `tf.Graph` as the default graph, using the `tf.Graph.as_default` context manager:"
